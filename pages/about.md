## About the Collection

Proposal 

The following document is a proposal from the Fine Arts department for a zine collection at the Central branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library. The term “zine” is short for fanzine or magazine. It is self-published alternative literature, usually made on paper and reproduced with a photocopier or printer. They are personal without the filter of publishers and editors offering an unprocessed experience that many of our underrepresented patrons seek. 

The Fine Arts department has multiple collection users. This list includes professors
from local universities interested in obtaining materials for their upcoming semester, high school students from Baltimore School for the Arts performing research for end of the year thesis papers and college students who are working towards their undergraduate or graduate degrees. The department also encounters practicing artists searching for inspiration or instruction and art enthusiasts who desire books on the latest new artists. Many of these customers would find value in this additional collection especially since zines are considered primary sources. 

The majority of zines are created by people of different ethnicities, genders, classes, ages, abilities, and sexual orientations. The addition of this collection would empower and enrich the quality of life for all of our patrons while also supporting current collections in neighboring departments such as Young Adult and Humanities.

Policy

The zine collection will closely follow Enoch Pratt Free Library’s current collection policy that serves as a guide for the selection, acquisition, maintenance, and retention of materials. The very heart of zines is their ability to give voice to those who are not traditionally represented in libraries, so the focus will be to include publications from underrepresented populations and zinesters from our local community. There will be no limit to diverse viewpoints or subject matter as long as it is clear that the work is of a scholarly nature.
