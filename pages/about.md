## About the Collection

The Rothnie Collection contains the earliest objects from a growing body of work that began in 2000. Maryland Institute College of Art alumni, Heather Rothnie, boasts twenty one-of-a-kind figures made of papier Mâché and acrylic paint. This whimsical collection has been made in a raw format to remind the viewer that we all have rough spots to our lives (similar to the material in this collection). But, a smile or small laugh like the ones found within each of these objects can bring out the bright moments in an unpredictable world.
