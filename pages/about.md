## About the Collection

Welcome to our growing collection! The majority of our zines are created by people of different ethnicities, genders, classes, ages, abilities, and sexual orientations. The addition of this collection to our library has strengthened our patron's lives while supporting established collections in neighboring departments such as Young Adult and Humanities.

The very heart of zines is their ability to give voice to those who are not traditionally represented in libraries, so the focus will always be to include publications from underrepresented populations and zinesters from our local community. There will be no limit to diverse viewpoints or subject matter as long as it is clear that the work is of a scholarly nature.
